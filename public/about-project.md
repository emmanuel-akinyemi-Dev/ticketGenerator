# Event Ticket Booking UI – Open Source Practice Project 🎟️

## Overview

This is a beginner-friendly yet practical **Event Ticket Booking UI** designed for developers to clone, explore, and build upon. The design focuses on a seamless, login-free ticket reservation flow, allowing users to book event tickets quickly and efficiently.

The project consists of a **three-step ticket booking flow**, and developers can extend it further by integrating **payment solutions, user authentication (optional), and ticket validation systems**.

## Flow & Features

### 1️⃣ Ticket Selection
- Users can browse available tickets (**Free & Paid**).
- Ticket options are displayed in a **list** or **card view**.
- **For Free Tickets** → Clicking **“Get Free Ticket”** proceeds to attendee details.
- **For Paid Tickets** → Clicking **“Purchase Ticket”** would ideally open a **payment modal**.

### 2️⃣ Attendee Details Form
- Users input their **Name, Email, and optional Phone Number**.
- **Profile picture upload** option with preview functionality.
- **Ticket summary** is visible to ensure users review their details before submission.

### 3️⃣ Payment or Success Page
- **If the ticket is free**, the user is taken directly to the **Ticket Confirmation Page**.
- **If the ticket is paid**, developers can integrate **Stripe, Paystack, or Flutterwave** to process payments before showing the confirmation page.
- Upon successful booking, users should receive:
  - A **visual ticket preview** with a unique **QR Code**.
  - An option to **download the ticket as a PDF** or save it to their device.
  - An **email confirmation** containing ticket details.

## How to Build This 🚀

### 📌 Frontend (**Next.js or React**)
**Component Breakdown:**
- `TicketCard.tsx` → Displays ticket details
- `AttendeeForm.tsx` → Captures user details
- `PaymentModal.tsx` → Handles payment processing
- `SuccessScreen.tsx` → Shows the final ticket preview

**State Management:**
- React’s Context API, Zustand, or Redux (if needed).

**File Handling:**
- Users should be able to upload images (**profile picture for ticket**) using:
  - **Firebase Storage**, **Cloudinary**, or
  - Local preview using `URL.createObjectURL()`.

### 📌 Backend (**Optional**)
If persistence is required, a backend can be built using:
- **Node.js & Express** or **Firebase Functions**
- **Database:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or Firebase Firestore to store ticket records

### 📌 Payment Integration
For paid events, developers should integrate:
- **Stripe Checkout** (for international transactions)
- **Paystack** or **Flutterwave** (for African users)

## What You’ll Learn 🧑‍💻
- **File handling & validation** (profile picture uploads).
- **Dynamic UI updates** based on ticket selection.
- **Persisting bookings** using local state or a backend.
- **Integrating payment gateways** for ticket purchases.
